#Happy Transport

> Upgrade your commute, help save the planet and keep more money in your pocket.

The results of our participation in the Hackakl 2014, weekend of ‘hacking for good’.

## Set up

This project is currently running on google app engine, however there are no dependencies apart from python
libraries, so if you decide to fork our work it should be easy to run anywhere.

If you want to run a version of the software as is visit: http://appengine.google.com, create an account
and upload with the requirements.txt symlinked.
